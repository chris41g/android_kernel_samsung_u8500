  <para>
	In ST-Ericsson's USB driver, the open source linux gadget stack and Mentor IP USB 2.0 driver is used. Since the USB Transceiver and Mentor USB IP controller are on different hardware, API's are defined for the communication between them. These API's are available in stm_musb.c file.
	The ST-Ericsson's USB driver doesn't have the internal DMA dedicated for USB. So, the external system DMA is used. The integration of external DMA with the mentor chip is available in stm_musb_dma.c file.
	Changes have been made in the musb_core.c file where endpoints are configured as per the platform and also integrated DMA specific chnages in the musb_gadget.c file. One new file ste_config.h is added which is platform specific.
     <!-- TODO: A brief introduction about the concepts
           which are introduced by the driver.
           Remove this chapter completely if there are no
           special concepts introduced by this driver.
